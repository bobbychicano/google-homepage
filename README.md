Project:
  Build the google homepage using HTML & CSS

This will be my first assignment during the course of The Odin Project. I am a bit familiar with creating a very simple website, having done a few before leaving to Mexico for two weeks. However, now that I've returned I'm rusty and I'm sure I'll have to look tons of things up. This marks the start though, into really attempting to develop a website.

I'll be using the developer tools in Chrome to deconstruct the Google home page. My goal is to also make the website responsive. I'll have to review the process for how to do that on internetingishard.com and in "HTML & CSS" by Jon Duckett. By the end of it all, I should have a deeper understanding of HTML & CSS, the process for constructing a website, developer tools, and the elements and selectors most used and most needed. A lot of work lies ahead, but after this, I'll be well on my way to continuing my learning of web development and reaching my goal of a career change. I need to earn money.

This will take grit, determination, lots of focus, and lots of work, but it's quarantine and I'm not employed so I definitely have the time. I can do this!
